\section{Computational Details}
In this section we will go through some of more details on how to set up the problem in order to solve it.  
\subsection{Operator splitting}
The meat of what we are looking to solve is the equation
\begin{equation}
 {\partial v \over \partial t} = \nabla \cdot (M_i \nabla) - I_{ion} (v,s)
\end{equation}
we could in principle solve this in one round, but as we do not have complete information about $I_{ion}(v,s)$, we typically
