\section{External packages}
Several packages is used in the code. Here is a brief overview of these.
\subsection{FEniCS}
FEniCS is a package for solving PDEs using the finite element method, and what our code uses to solve the PDE part of the heart equation. FEniCS has a relatively good documentation\cite{FEniCS}, so i will not go into detail here. 

\subsection{gotran}
Gotran is a sympy-based packed for storing stimulation ODEs. ODEs in gotran format are typically stored in \verb .ode  files. From python, you will typically only call the function \verb load_ode(filename) , where filename is the name of the .ode file you want to use. 

\subsection{goss}
