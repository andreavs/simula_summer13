\section*{Preface}
 During the summer of 2013 i have written an object oriented code which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) terms of the monodomain heart equations. The code solves the PDE by using the FEniCS software\cite{FEniCS}, and recieves as input the solution of the coupled system of ODEs in the heart equation, typically as provided by the packages goss\cite{goss} and gotran\cite{gotran}. The purpose of this report is to detail the work done, as well as to note some of the pitfalls encountered underway. 
 
 If you are reading this, you are most likely my employer, or someone looking to use the code developed, in order to not have to re-invent the wheel. This report is mostly aimed at the latter. We start with a brief review of the theory (a more full description is given in \cite{Sundnes06}), and then spend some time going into details on the produced code. There will also be notes explaining the other minor files found among the produced code. Beware! This code was worked on for a mere six weeks, and never polished properly. There might be parts of the code that is unclear, ineffective or even completely wrong. 
 
 If you wish to make changes to or improve the code in some way, feel free to contact me, in order to become a collaborator on the code. If you only wish to use the code, it can be found at the gitub repository \cite{source}.
